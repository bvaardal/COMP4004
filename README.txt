-- ITERATION 2 --
-----------------
=Test Data Generation=
The test data is created from the view (File -> Create test data). It can be inserted into and 
existing DB or a new DB. A dialog will open and let the user input the number of patients and
visits, both for matching and random. The default values are the ones specified in Iteration 2.
	MATCHING PATIENTS are generated by creating the patients, then creating a set of matching 
	visits (only date and rational) and inserting these for each of the patients with the other 
	attributes of the visits randomized.
	RANDOM PATIENTS are generated by creating the patients, then creating visits for all patients
	with all visit attributes randomized for all visits.
For clean results, create a new DB from the File menu.

=DB queries=
The DB queries are not involved in generating any solution data (e.g. sage patients). My DB queries
only provide stored data with some filter capabilities.

=Computations=
All the required computation is done by the program itself:
	- ACVs for a given patient
	- Patients whos ACV(s) match a CM
	- Safe patients
	- Unsafe patients
